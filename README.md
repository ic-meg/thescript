# 🖥️ The<Script> Portfolio | 2025 Edition



Welcome to The<Script> Portfolio, a creative showcase built by a group of aspiring developers from Cavite State University - Imus Campus. This midterm project for Web Systems and Technologies 2 (ITEC 106A) is inspired by the classic Windows 95 interface, designed to represent our skills, projects, and profiles in a nostalgic, yet modern format.

🎨 Theme & Concept
Our portfolio mimics a vintage operating system desktop complete with draggable windows, retro scrollbars, a taskbar, and pixel-style icons. The goal? To stand out — both technically and creatively — while celebrating the retro tech aesthetics we love.
