      {/* Intro Paragraph */}
      <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
        As a team of developers passionate about both hardware and software, we built a Smart Coffee Machine that merges everyday convenience with automation. This project showcases our ability to work with microcontrollers, payment integration, and UI design — all while making sure nobody misses their caffeine fix.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8 text-justify">
        Our coffee machine accepts both coin and GCash payments, features a touchscreen interface, and allows users to choose between 3-in-1 or black coffee with customizable sugar and creamer options. With Arduino handling the logic, it brings together real-world interaction and automation in one machine.

        <li>Accepts payment via coin slot or GCash scan</li>
        <li>Users interact with a touchscreen to select coffee options</li>
        <li>Arduino processes the input and triggers dispensing via relays</li>
        <li>The drink is dispensed automatically and the system resets</li>

      While the journey wasn't easy, our first presentation came with its share of challenges — we struggled to complete the full functionality in time, which took a toll on us both mentally and emotionally. But despite the setbacks, we pulled through. We stayed calm, kept going, and eventually delivered the presentation the way we envisioned it. It may not have been perfect, but it was a success — and a moment we’re proud of.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-justify">
        We’re especially grateful to our instructors for believing in us and giving us the opportunity to present again. Their understanding and support meant a lot, and it gave us the chance to prove what we were truly capable of.
