          the&lt;script&gt;.vercel.app is our team’s portfolio site — the one you're viewing right now!
          This project was built as part of our Web Systems & Technologies 2 midterm.
          It's fully inspired by the classic Windows 95 look, and includes animated UI,
          retro assets, and project windows to simulate an old-school OS.
          <br /><br />
          It was built using ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and a lot of pixel-perfect CSS. We started this around early April and developed it collaboratively using GitHub. We focused on making it responsive, modular, and retro-accurate — all for the love of tech and nostalgia!

        <p className="text-[15px] -[750px] text-justify mt-2">
          The Tea Spillers is a simple billing system made using Python and Tkinter for the GUI (graphical user interface). 
          Users can order from a menu and choose their customer status — student, senior, or regular. 
          Each type gets a different discount. For payment, they can pay using cash or e-wallet like GCash. 
          After the payment, the system creates a receipt that the user can view or print. It’s not a perfect system, 
          but it looks a bit like a cashier’s POS (point of sale) and also feels like a small self-service kiosk you see in cafes.

          The ATM system is a self-service machine that allows people to do different banking tasks 
          like withdrawing cash, depositing money, checking account balances, transferring money, and paying bills, 
          all without needing to talk to a bank teller. 
          <br /><br />
          This system is built using the Java's Graphical User Interface (GUI) framework, which makes it secure and reliable. Java helps the ATM handle many transactions safely, with features like data protection and PIN verification to keep everything secure.

        <p className="text-[15px] -[750px] text-justify mt-2">
          An Online Enrollment System is a website that allows students to register for courses or subjects using 
          the internet. It replaces the traditional, manual enrollment process by providing a fast, easy, and convenient way for 
          students, parents, and school staff to manage enrollment.
          <br /><br />
          This ongoing project is being built using PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, and SQL. PHP handles the system's core functionalities like processing user actions and managing enrollments. HTML and CSS are used to create a responsive, user-friendly interface that works well across all devices. SQL is used for securely storing and managing student records, allowing for efficient updates and data retrieval. By combining these technologies, we are creating a streamlined, accessible system for both students and administrators.
