          <p className="text-lg">
            The name <b>"The&lt;Script&gt;"</b> is inspired by the concept of JavaScript, which play a big role in our project. We also added the &lt;script&gt; tag as a symbol of our journey—we are just starting, and we hope it never ends.

          <p className="text-lg mt-4">
            We are not the famous band <b>"The Script"</b>, but a group of 3rd-year college students passionate about web development. This portfolio is not just for showcasing our skills but also for future opportunities. We want it to be something we can use as a reference as we grow in our careers.

            To build this portfolio, we used <b>ReactJS, Tailwind CSS,</b> and <b>React Router</b>. These tools helped us create a smooth, modern, and responsive design. This project reflects our dedication and creativity, and we hope it inspires others who are also starting their journey in web development.
